# Trip Agency sample

## WARNING FOR MAVEN USERS: THE 'TARGET' FOLDER IS REPLACED BY A FOLDER NAMED 'BUILD'
And this for two reasons:
- the first is that 'build' is more accurate than 'target'.
- the second is that it is the same as gradle.  
We can say that we killed two birds with one stone.

## 1 Sample goals
This sample was made to provide a concrete example on some best practices of the market regarding a java application providing Rest API.  
Everything may be not perfect. This sample will always be on WIP.  
Be kind and don't hesitate to do some PR/MR ^^  
Everyone is welcome!  

This sample has many goals:
- to use best building tools practices: use of BOM (Bills Of Materials) and wrapper (MavenWrapper and GradleWrapper in this sample)
- to teach the basis of automated tests based on Cucumber (Behaviour Driven Development)
- to generate a living documentation based on the tests
- to use the hexagonal architecture, an architectural pattern that allows dissociating the domain code from the technical 
code and ease also the tests implementation without infrastructure
- to use i18n (internationalization)
- to use best practices for CI/CD pipelines (shell scripts in the project to be used in the different CI servers)
- to use a database managing tools (liquibase here)

## 2 Wrappers and practices to build
to fill
### 2-1 Maven wrapper
to fill
### 2-2 Gradle wrapper
to fill
### 2-3 Bom for Bills Of Materials
to fill

## 3 xDD
to fill
### 3-1 DDD
Ubiquitous language
### 3-2 BDD
Specifications by examples implemented with Cucumber
### 3-3 TDD
to fill


## 4 Living Documentation
Cukedoctor  
See in the following repository in the domain module: domain/build/TripAgency   
You should see a pdf file containing the results of the cucumber tests.

## 5 Hexagonal architecture
Multi modules: 
- domain (the most important module)
- infrastructure (infrastructure repository) and exposition (infrastructure driver) for the technical ones

## 6 DataBase Managing tool
Liquibase: Database version control and deployment

## 7 I18n
to fill

## 8 CI/CD best practices
For all the following parts of this chapter, a better possibility is to encapsulate your command in a shell script.
You can also use a Makefile. This is what I have done here.
Create also an alias that can be called from a project and do the work.
Example **build** or **make build** for a **./mvnw install** or **./gradlew build** command.

## 9 Let's make it work
Have a look at the **Makefile** file to see the actions you can do.

### Compilation
To make the project build, you can use the following commands depending on the tool you want to use:
**./mvnw install** or **./gradlew build**

### Generate the living documentation
Here is the command to generate the living documentation with Cukedoctor where
- CUKEDOCTOR_MAIN_JAR is the path to 'cukedoctor-main.jar'
- PROJECT_VERSION is the version number of the project

This command should be executed after the execution of Cucumber tests. You can find some in the **domain** and **e2e** modules.

``
java -jar ${CUKEDOCTOR_MAIN_JAR} 
      -o "build/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_living_documentation-${PROJECT_VERSION}" 
      -p "build/cucumber/{{project_name}}.json" 
  	  -t "{{project_name}}_living_documentation" 
  	  -f all 
  	  -numbered 
  	  -hideSummarySection 
  	  -hideScenarioKeyword
``

### Generate sonar reports
Here is the command to execute sonar reports generation where:
- SONAR_URL is the sonar server url
- SONAR_CREDENTIALS are the credentials to send the reports
This two variable have been added in an **.env** file in the home folder.

sonar-scanner has to be installed for this command to work.

``
source ~/.env
sonar-scanner -Dsonar.host.url=${SONAR_URL} -Dsonar.login=${SONAR_CREDENTIALS} -Dsonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8
``

### Launching locally your rest api
you can start the rest exposition by executing the following command line in the exposition folder:  
**mvn clean spring-boot:run**  

The url to use the service is the following:  
**http://localhost:12378/{{project_name}}/swagger-ui/**

### Consulting the H2 DB
Connect to this url:
**http://localhost:12378/{{project_name}}/h2-console**
Fill the information regarding your configuration
